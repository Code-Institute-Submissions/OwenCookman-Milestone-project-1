[#Warhammer 40,000]

The objective of this webpage is to provide an introduction to the Warhammer 40,000 universe along with an introduction to some of the original factions.
As the warhammer 40,000 universe has a huge rich background of lore and factions it can be quite daunting for new players, collectors and readers to pick 
up.
The idea behind this website is to create an introduction for people interested in Warhammer 40,000 without overloading them with information and still 
providing the means to gain access to any further information that they might want, this will help to drive traffic towards games workshop's other websites 
as well as social media pages and in turn drive up sales.

[###UX]

The website is aimed at people who have an interest in the Warhammer 40,000 universe weather it is collecting, painting and/or playing the various games set 
in the universe or the novels and background itself which interests them, the universe is a huge and daunting thing to get in to and it may be difficult for
new players to find where to start.
This website would be used as an introduction to the Warhammer 40,000 universe as well as an introduction to some of the classic factions providing a portal
to the various Games workshop websites so users can easily find their way to the content that they are looking for.
Without going too deeply in to the sub factions that belong to the many factions of the Warhammer 40,000 universe this project provides introductory
information to give users an idea of the background without overloading them with infromation but also provides them with the means to find the information
that they are most interested in.

[###User Stories]

[####collector/player user type]
As a user who is interested in collecting the models and playing the game, I want to gain insight in to some of the factions so that I can make a decision
on where to start and which faction interests me the most. I arrive at the index.html page and watch the video at the top of the screen to gain some insight
and interest in the setting, I then scroll down and click the downwards chevron which opens up some introductory text as well as text that describes the 
different aspects of the hobby. I then click the upwards pointing chevron so that the paragraphs collapse away again. Below this are four interesting images
that depict different factions of the game, clicking on each opens up information about each factions background. Underneath the images is a piece of text
which says "sign up to our newsletter" and below that is an envelope icon, clicking this opens up a prompt to enter my email address which closes after I 
have entered it. further down the page are four more images that are titled and below them is a description of what I can find on each website, further 
below that are icons that take me to games workshops different social media platforms, I find that I want to look at miniatures and read in to what the
armies are capable of so I choose to click on the Games workshop image, this opens up a new tab in my browser and loads the web page.

[####fiction reader user type]
As a user who is interested in reading the warhammer 40,000 fiction, I want to learn more about the background that the universe is set in and who lives
within that universe. I arrive at the index.html page and watch the video at the top of the screen to gain some insight in to the background and some of 
the characters that are there, this also gives me a good idea if the setting is something that interests me. Scrolling further down the page I find some
more information that sets the scene of the warhammer 40,000 universe and gives me some insight in to how dark the setting is. Scrolling further down the
page 


As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

[###Features]

[#### Navbar]

The Navbar used in this project was taken from Bootstraps library and then styled with CSS, some of the list items were re ordered and an additional one 
was added to match the layout of the page. The navbar is fixed so that a user can move to any part of the page from anywhere on the page.

[#### Introduction Video]

Using a Bootstrap embed this video was taken from Warhammer TV, games workshops youtube channel, it is placed at the top of the page as a way to catch the
users attention and build some interest and insight in to the setting. As the video is quite large, on smaller screens it is replaced by an image instead.

[#### Introduction text]

As this is a large block of text it includes an image to break up the information, one block is to set the scene while the other speaks about the hobby itself.
On smaller screens this information is placed within a collapse which was taken from bootstrap so there isn't too much information on the screen for a user
and the text can be collapsed away once finished with.

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
