                    <p class="faction-info">Space Marines are organised into Chapters, each consisting of one thousand battle-brothers and possessed of their own armouries, fighting vehicles, space fleets and towering fortress monasteries. Though there is less than one warrior
                        of the Adeptus Astartes for every planet in the Imperium, it is a testament to their sheer might and heroism that this number is still sufficient to hurl back the enemies of Humanity upon every front. Space Marines are genetically
                        engineered super-human warriors. Armed and armoured with the best equipment the Imperium can provide, they are the Emperor’s most elite fighting forces. To the Space Marines fall the most desperate and vital of the Imperium’s battles,
                        holding the line where all others have fallen, or striking like the Emperor’s own blade to bring death to xenos warlords and daemonic abominations alike.</p>

                        the flesh from a foe with sickening ease. All manner of hideous creatures dwell within the warp, a hellish, roiling dimension in which the greatest passions and fears of mortal creatures are given terrible form. Acts of monstrous
                        atrocity or foul ritual can weaken the barriers between realms, unleashing the nightmare of a daemonic incursion into realspace. Led by horrifically powerful Greater Daemons and Daemon Princes – mortals who have been granted the
                        gift of Daemonhood – these profane hosts fight alongside bands of Heretic Astartes and crazed cultists.</p>
                    <p class="faction-info">The Heretic Astartes are Humanity’s greatest foes, traitorous Space Marines who have turned from the light of the Emperor and embraced the baleful glory of Chaos. Consumed with bitter hatred, these champions of ruin prey upon the Imperium
                        they once swore to defend. The warbands and Legions of the Heretic Astartes each fight in their own unique manner; the World Eaters, for example, are berserkers who worship Khorne, the Blood God, and fall upon their foes in a gore-splattered
                        orgy of slaughter. The Night Lords employ terror tactics to soften up their prey before striking from the darkness, while the Crimson Slaughter are relatively new to the ranks of Renegade Space Marines using the poltergeists that
                        haunt them against the agents of the Corpse Emperor.</p>

                        some xenos exist only on a single planet, other civilisations might occupy a star system and there are a few that are widely spread across the great void of the galaxy. It has never been in Man’s nature to share his worlds with
                        aliens, and bloodshed has ever formed the foundation of empire.</p>
                    <p class="faction-info">The belligerent and warlike Orks have been a blight on the galaxy since time immemorial. The entire culture of these brutish xenos is centred around warfare. They live for the exhilaration of a good fight, the deafening thunder of
                        gunfire, and the rush of hurtling into battle in speeding, ramshackle fighting vehicles. When gathered into their billions-strong hordes they can spell the doom of entire space sectors. Ork technology is scrapped together from
                        whatever raw materials are found near to hand, and as a result it is ramshackle, crude and often dangerously unreliable. Despite, or perhaps because of this unpredictability, it can also be utterly deadly – to the wielder as well
                        as his target. When Orks gather in sufficient numbers, flocking to the banners of the hulking brutes known as Warbosses, they will embark upon a Waaagh! – an unstoppable crusade driven by unquenchable battle-lust. Vast hordes of
                        Orks sweep across planet after planet, crushing all before them in a deafening, smoke-belching tide of clanking war machines. All semblance or order and civilisation is torn down, shattered and burned, and amidst the ashes the
                        Orks gather around their towering war effigies, bellowing praises to the monstrous gods they call Gork and Mork.</p>

                        they tread secret paths beyond the bounds of reality, and their towering psychic might allows them to read and weave the strands of fate itself. Yet for all this the Aeldari are but an echo, a faded, splintered remnant of their
                        former glory. Their numbers dwindle by the decade, and their battle is now one of survival, not supremacy. Although only a shadow of their former glory, the Aeldari are still a formidable power. Confident in the superiority of
                        their technology and martial prowess, the Aeldari justifiably look down on the barbaric usurpers that have overrun the galaxy. Who could compare the crude, smoke-belching engines of Man or Ork to the sleek grav tanks or streaking
                        jetbikes of the Aeldari? In combat, observe how lumbering and slow the movements of a human soldier are against the precise, graceful attack of an Aeldari. Only in sheer numbers do the Aeldari come up short in comparison to the
                        other forces in the galaxy, though the quick-striking Aeldari way of war can offset this lone disadvantage.</p>
