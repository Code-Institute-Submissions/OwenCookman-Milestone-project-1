                <img class="float-left" src="assets/images/spacemarine.jpg"></img>
                <p class="faction-info">Over ten thousand years of constant warfare has honed Mankind’s military might, for the galaxy is a hostile place and only by force of arms is the Imperium held together. It is an age of war and only the strong and the ruthless can hope
                    to survive. Out amongst the stars there can be no mercy, no weakness and no respite from the unending war for survival. Space Marines are organised into Chapters, each consisting of one thousand battle-brothers and possessed of their
                    own armouries, fighting vehicles, space fleets and towering fortress monasteries. Though there is less than one warrior of the Adeptus Astartes for every planet in the Imperium, it is a testament to their sheer might and heroism that
                    this number is still sufficient to hurl back the enemies of Humanity upon every front. Space Marines are genetically engineered super-human warriors. Armed and armoured with the best equipment the Imperium can provide, they are the
                    Emperor’s most elite fighting forces. To the Space Marines fall the most desperate and vital of the Imperium’s battles, holding the line where all others have fallen, or striking like the Emperor’s own blade to bring death to xenos
                    warlords and daemonic abominations alike.</p>

                <img class="float-right" src="assets/images/chaosspacemarine.jpg"></img>
                <p class="faction-info">As the favoured champions of the Chaos Gods, the Heretic Astartes are blessed with many gifts. They may have profane boons bestowed upon them which grant unnatural strength and resilience, or horrific weapon-mutations that can peel the
                    flesh from a foe with sickening ease. All manner of hideous creatures dwell within the warp, a hellish, roiling dimension in which the greatest passions and fears of mortal creatures are given terrible form. Acts of monstrous atrocity
                    or foul ritual can weaken the barriers between realms, unleashing the nightmare of a daemonic incursion into realspace. Led by horrifically powerful Greater Daemons and Daemon Princes – mortals who have been granted the gift of Daemonhood
                    – these profane hosts fight alongside bands of Heretic Astartes and crazed cultists. The Heretic Astartes are Humanity’s greatest foes, traitorous Space Marines who have turned from the light of the Emperor and embraced the baleful
                    glory of Chaos. Consumed with bitter hatred, these champions of ruin prey upon the Imperium they once swore to defend. The warbands and Legions of the Heretic Astartes each fight in their own unique manner; the World Eaters, for example,
                    are berserkers who worship Khorne, the Blood God, and fall upon their foes in a gore-splattered orgy of slaughter. The Night Lords employ terror tactics to soften up their prey before striking from the darkness, while the Crimson Slaughter
                    are relatively new to the ranks of Renegade Space Marines using the poltergeists that haunt them against the agents of the Corpse Emperor.</p>

                <img class="float-left" src="assets/images/ork.jpg"></img>
                <p class="faction-info">Mankind is not the only race to walk among the stars. Since they first travelled beyond their own star system, in the early days of the Age of Technology, Mankind has encountered alien races, most of which have proven hostile. While some
                    xenos exist only on a single planet, other civilisations might occupy a star system and there are a few that are widely spread across the great void of the galaxy. It has never been in Man’s nature to share his worlds with aliens,
                    and bloodshed has ever formed the foundation of empire. The belligerent and warlike Orks have been a blight on the galaxy since time immemorial. The entire culture of these brutish xenos is centred around warfare. They live for the
                    exhilaration of a good fight, the deafening thunder of gunfire, and the rush of hurtling into battle in speeding, ramshackle fighting vehicles. When gathered into their billions-strong hordes they can spell the doom of entire space
                    sectors. Ork technology is scrapped together from whatever raw materials are found near to hand, and as a result it is ramshackle, crude and often dangerously unreliable. Despite, or perhaps because of this unpredictability, it can
                    also be utterly deadly – to the wielder as well as his target. When Orks gather in sufficient numbers, flocking to the banners of the hulking brutes known as Warbosses, they will embark upon a Waaagh! – an unstoppable crusade driven
                    by unquenchable battle-lust. Vast hordes of Orks sweep across planet after planet, crushing all before them in a deafening, smoke-belching tide of clanking war machines. All semblance or order and civilisation is torn down, shattered
                    and burned, and amidst the ashes the Orks gather around their towering war effigies, bellowing praises to the monstrous gods they call Gork and Mork.</p>

                <img class="float-right" src="assets/images/eldar.jpg"></img>
                <p class="faction-info">The Aeldari are an alien race that once ruled the galaxy. Technologically, militarily and intellectually the Aeldari are as far superior to Humanity as Humanity are to primitive simians. They possess weapons that can extinguish stars,
                    they tread secret paths beyond the bounds of reality, and their towering psychic might allows them to read and weave the strands of fate itself. Yet for all this the Aeldari are but an echo, a faded, splintered remnant of their former
                    glory. Their numbers dwindle by the decade, and their battle is now one of survival, not supremacy. Although only a shadow of their former glory, the Aeldari are still a formidable power. Confident in the superiority of their technology
                    and martial prowess, the Aeldari justifiably look down on the barbaric usurpers that have overrun the galaxy. Who could compare the crude, smoke-belching engines of Man or Ork to the sleek grav tanks or streaking jetbikes of the Aeldari?
                    In combat, observe how lumbering and slow the movements of a human soldier are against the precise, graceful attack of an Aeldari. Only in sheer numbers do the Aeldari come up short in comparison to the other forces in the galaxy,
                    though the quick-striking Aeldari way of war can offset this lone disadvantage.</p>

                        holding the line where all others have fallen, or striking like the Emperor’s own blade to bring death to xenos warlords and daemonic abominations alike.</p>

                    <p class="faction-info">As the favoured champions of the Chaos Gods, the Heretic Astartes are blessed with many gifts. They may have profane boons bestowed upon them which grant unnatural strength and resilience, or horrific weapon-mutations that can peel
                        the flesh from a foe with sickening ease. All manner of hideous creatures dwell within the warp, a hellish, roiling dimension in which the greatest passions and fears of mortal creatures are given terrible form. Acts of monstrous
                        atrocity or foul ritual can weaken the barriers between realms, unleashing the nightmare of a daemonic incursion into realspace. Led by horrifically powerful Greater Daemons and Daemon Princes – mortals who have been granted the
                        gift of Daemonhood – these profane hosts fight alongside bands of Heretic Astartes and crazed cultists.</p>
                    <p class="faction-info">The Heretic Astartes are Humanity’s greatest foes, traitorous Space Marines who have turned from the light of the Emperor and embraced the baleful glory of Chaos. Consumed with bitter hatred, these champions of ruin prey upon the Imperium
                        they once swore to defend. The warbands and Legions of the Heretic Astartes each fight in their own unique manner; the World Eaters, for example, are berserkers who worship Khorne, the Blood God, and fall upon their foes in a gore-splattered
                        orgy of slaughter. The Night Lords employ terror tactics to soften up their prey before striking from the darkness, while the Crimson Slaughter are relatively new to the ranks of Renegade Space Marines using the poltergeists that
                        haunt them against the agents of the Corpse Emperor.</p>

                    <p class="faction-info">Mankind is not the only race to walk among the stars. Since they first travelled beyond their own star system, in the early days of the Age of Technology, Mankind has encountered alien races, most of which have proven hostile. While
                        some xenos exist only on a single planet, other civilisations might occupy a star system and there are a few that are widely spread across the great void of the galaxy. It has never been in Man’s nature to share his worlds with
                        aliens, and bloodshed has ever formed the foundation of empire.</p>
                    <p class="faction-info">The belligerent and warlike Orks have been a blight on the galaxy since time immemorial. The entire culture of these brutish xenos is centred around warfare. They live for the exhilaration of a good fight, the deafening thunder of
                        gunfire, and the rush of hurtling into battle in speeding, ramshackle fighting vehicles. When gathered into their billions-strong hordes they can spell the doom of entire space sectors. Ork technology is scrapped together from
                        whatever raw materials are found near to hand, and as a result it is ramshackle, crude and often dangerously unreliable. Despite, or perhaps because of this unpredictability, it can also be utterly deadly – to the wielder as well
                        as his target. When Orks gather in sufficient numbers, flocking to the banners of the hulking brutes known as Warbosses, they will embark upon a Waaagh! – an unstoppable crusade driven by unquenchable battle-lust. Vast hordes of
                        Orks sweep across planet after planet, crushing all before them in a deafening, smoke-belching tide of clanking war machines. All semblance or order and civilisation is torn down, shattered and burned, and amidst the ashes the
                        Orks gather around their towering war effigies, bellowing praises to the monstrous gods they call Gork and Mork.</p>

                    <p class="faction-info">The Aeldari are an alien race that once ruled the galaxy. Technologically, militarily and intellectually the Aeldari are as far superior to Humanity as Humanity are to primitive simians. They possess weapons that can extinguish stars,
                        they tread secret paths beyond the bounds of reality, and their towering psychic might allows them to read and weave the strands of fate itself. Yet for all this the Aeldari are but an echo, a faded, splintered remnant of their
                        former glory. Their numbers dwindle by the decade, and their battle is now one of survival, not supremacy. Although only a shadow of their former glory, the Aeldari are still a formidable power. Confident in the superiority of
                        their technology and martial prowess, the Aeldari justifiably look down on the barbaric usurpers that have overrun the galaxy. Who could compare the crude, smoke-belching engines of Man or Ork to the sleek grav tanks or streaking
                        jetbikes of the Aeldari? In combat, observe how lumbering and slow the movements of a human soldier are against the precise, graceful attack of an Aeldari. Only in sheer numbers do the Aeldari come up short in comparison to the
                        other forces in the galaxy, though the quick-striking Aeldari way of war can offset this lone disadvantage.</p>
